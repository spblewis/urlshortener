# URL Shortener Microservice

This project is not always turned on.  When turned on it is available at https://urlshortener.spblewis.repl.co

An introductory project tying together some basic functions with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.  It stores a URL to a shortened form at one API endpoint, then when queried for that shortened form (by directing the browser to https://urlshortener.spblewis.repl.co/api/shorturl/:target where :target is the shortened url), redirects to the original URL stored in the database.

The boilerplate for this project is provided by the wonderful folks at freeCodeCamp
